# SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up


## Background

In this challenge, there were major components, the _Climate Analysis and Exploration_ and the _Climate App_

## Climate Analysis and Exploration

The code for the Climate and Analysis and Exploration can be seen in the file climate.ipynb
Here, I did multiple analyses.

First the results of the precipitation analysis.  This was looking at the precipitation of all statation in the last year of data - 08/23/16 to 08/23/17. Here is a plot of the results

Second are the results of the station analysis.

If we are looking at the station with the most observations **in the dataset**, the results are for Waihee, which is here

If we are looking at the station with the most observations **in the dataset _in the last year_**, the results are for Waikiki, which are found here

## Climate App

Code for the climate app can be found under app.py.  Enter "python app.py" into a terminal.  You then will go to [http://127.0.0.5000/](http://127.00.5000/) to start the results.
